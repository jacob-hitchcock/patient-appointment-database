# Patient Appointment Database
In this project, I was tacked with planning, documenting, and implementing a database to be used for a hypothetical appointment scheduling application.

## The Application
The proposed application that I was designing for handled the scheduling of appointments between patients and doctors.

The application would allow the user to:
* Search for **existing patients**
* Add a **new patient**
* Search for **doctor**
* Select a **clinic**
* Select an **appointment** date and time

## Database Design
There were a couple of criteria pertaining to the design of the database. 

1) The database had to use normalization, constraints, and abstraction layers
2) Each table required a view, an insert, an update, and a delete stored procedure
3) Stored procedures had to have explicit transactions, error handling, and testing code included in the script

## Deliverables
This project was presented over a series of 4 milestones, detailed below

### Milestone 01
This milestone presented the process of desiging the database. Design decisions were made based solely on the proposed application and user flow. Changes to the design choices in the milestone 01 deliverables may be different by the final milestone.

### Milestone 02
